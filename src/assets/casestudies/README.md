# Case study images

Add your case study images in this folder, then register them in `index.ts`.

**Naming (examples):**
- Just My Look: `justmylook-1.jpg`, `justmylook-2.jpg`, …
- Base London: `baselondon-1.jpg`, …
- Close Company: `closecompany-1.jpg`, …
- Reboxed: `reboxed-1.jpg`, …

**In `index.ts`:**
1. Add imports at the top, e.g. `import justmylook1 from "./justmylook-1.jpg"`
2. Add the imported images into the array for that case study, e.g. `const justmylookImages = [justmylook1, justmylook2]`

Images will show in the **Selected Work** cards (thumbnail grid) and on each **work detail page** (Screenshots section).
