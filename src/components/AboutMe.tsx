            Hi, I&apos;m [Your Name], a Shopify theme and app developer based
            in the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work with Shopify agencies and ecommerce brands to build
            high-performance storefronts, custom features, and Shopify apps
            that help businesses scale. I focus on clean code, fast delivery,
            and conversion-friendly user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background is personal. I was adopted by an American family after
            losing my biological parents at a young age. That experience shaped
            who I am — resilient, hardworking, and deeply committed to building a
            stable and meaningful career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I bring that same mindset into every Shopify project I work
            on: consistency, reliability, and pride in delivering high-quality
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of development, I&apos;m passionate about ecommerce strategy
            and enjoy building long-term partnerships with teams that value
            quality and reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you&apos;re looking for a long-term Shopify development partner,
            I&apos;d love to connect.
