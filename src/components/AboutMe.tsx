            Hi, I&apos;m Aleks Ito, a Shopify theme and app developer based
            in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work with <strong className="text-slate-300">Shopify agencies and ecommerce brands</strong> to build high-performance storefronts, custom features, and apps that drive growth. My expertise is in theme development (Liquid, Shopify 2.0), app development (Admin API, Storefront API), speed and Core Web Vitals, CRO, and SEO — all with clean code and conversion-focused UX. For agencies I provide white-label support; for brands I work as your direct development partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background is personal. I was adopted by an American family after
            losing my biological parents at a young age. That experience shaped
            who I am — resilient, hardworking, and deeply committed to building a
            stable and meaningful career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I bring that same mindset into every Shopify project I work
            on: consistency, reliability, and pride in delivering high-quality
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of development, I&apos;m passionate about ecommerce strategy
            and enjoy building long-term partnerships with teams that value
            quality and reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you&apos;re looking for a long-term Shopify development partner,
            I&apos;d love to connect.
