            <strong className="text-slate-300">Ecommerce brands:</strong> I work directly with you as your development partner — one-off builds, ongoing optimization, or dedicated support. Clean code, clear communication, and a focus on conversion and revenue. <strong className="text-slate-300">Agencies:</strong> I provide white-label Shopify development so you can deliver more without growing headcount. Your clients see your brand; I stay in the background with quality code and on-time delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m comfortable with <strong className="text-slate-300">Slack, Jira, GitHub</strong> (or your existing tools). I fit into your workflow, follow your conventions, and leave documentation so your team can maintain or extend the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m typically <strong className="text-slate-300">available 20–40 hrs/week</strong> for ongoing work. Whether you&apos;re a brand or an agency, we can start with a <strong className="text-slate-300">trial task or small project</strong> so you can see how I work before committing to a retainer.
